Goaltending edge: Darcy Kuemper has been Vezina-caliber for LA, stopping 24 more goals than expected this season.
Defensive vs Offensive tactical matchup
This series is a textbook battle of styles:
Los Angeles Kings: Best defense structure in the NHL, three quality defensive centers, top shutdown trio of Mikey Anderson, Vladislav Gavrikov and Drew Doughty. Their home-ice goal differential (100-48) is the top in the game, but the offensive production wanes on the road.
Edmonton Oilers: Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl-fronted high-octane offense with Evan Bouchard and a mobile blue line. The Oilers are still deadly on the power play, but their even-strength finishing is regressing and they’ll lose Mattias Ekholm’s defensive presence at least in the first round.
X-Factors & Key Players
Kings
Quinton Byfield: After a breakout season on the wing, Byfield is back down the middle and with a bigger role. How well he drives play and matches with Edmonton’s stars is critical.
Kevin Fiala & Adrian Kempe: Bring the offensive muscle; Fiala’s 30th goal and Kempe’s 31st assist fueled 3-0 victory in last meeting.
Darcy Kuemper: Goaltending might be the deciding factor. Kuemper's late-season form gives LA an obvious edge the et.
Oilers
Connor McDavid & Leon Draisaitl: The NHL's best duo. McDavid has 36 points in 18 playoff games vs LA; Draisaitl — 17 goals, 30 points.
Evan Bouchard: One of the NHL’s best offensive defensemen, and even more important with Ekholm out of the lineup.
Depth Forwards: Edmonton’s secondary scoring looks lighter than Yin’s years ledgers, meaning contributions from the likes of Corey Perry, Connor Brown and Adam Henrique will be crucial.
Special Teams Battle
Oilers’ power play: One of the best in the NHL, biggest weapon if Kings penalized.
Kings’ PK faces a test; stay disciplined, LA’s power play ranks below league average.
Previous Game: Kings 3, Oilers 0 (4/5/25)
In their last regular season matchup, the Kings shut out the Oilers 3-0:
Goals: Kevin Fiala, Andrei Kuzmenko, Trevor Lewis (EN)
All four players had multi-point games, and Doughty moved into a tie for the NHL lead in assists.
Goaltending: Kuemper turned away everything for the shutout
And this game demonstrated LA’s both ability to smother Edmonton’s stars and when to make them count—a foreshadowing of playoff success.
Lineup & Injury Watch
Oilers: Mattias Ekholm (top defenseman) is out at least first round, which burdens Darnell Nurse and Bouchard with major minutes. Evander Kane and Trent Frederic are expected to make their return, adding more physicality and two-way play.
Kings: No major injuries; their No. 1 defense pair and center depth are healthy and primed for a matchup against McDavid and Draisaitl.

Prediction: Expert Prediction & Tips for Betting
Prediction: Kings vs Oilers, and this year is closer than ever:
Kings have a marginal statistical edge, especially at home, because of their depth and defense.
The Oilers’ star power (McDavid, Draisaitl) can still turn any game on a dime, but the team’s lack of finishing and defensive injuries are worrisome.
Betting tip: Get used to the fact that most games are going to be tight and low-scoring (keep an eye on the trend for under 6 goals). If LA can keep Edmonton’s power play at bay then they might finally get over the hump. But it’s always dangerous to bet against McDavid and Draisaitl in a Game 7.
Conclusion
The 2025 Los Angeles Kings vs Edmonton Oilers playoff series features elite defense vs superstar offense, and both teams have a reasonable belief they can go a long way. The Kings have better depth than ever, and they also have home-ice advantage and a goaltender who is still hot or just getting hot — and that combination makes this their best chance in years to knock off Edmonton. But given that both McDavid and Draisaitl have playoff pedigree, the Oilers are still a dangerous threat. And this series should feature the drama, intensity and some of the best postseason hockey available to fans and bettors looking for NHL playoff betting tips and Kings vs Oilers predictions.
